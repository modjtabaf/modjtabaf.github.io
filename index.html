Welcome to my corner. I am a mechanical/mechatronics engineer, but I am a big fan of computer programming too. After I entered the university as an undergraduate student, I realized I was so interested in computer programming. Those days (mid 90's) Quick Basic was the programming language of choice for newbies like me. I started learning QB, but after a few months I advanced to Pascal, which I believed was a great language. At the same time, I enrolled in a computer programming course at the university which was based on Fortran 77. Fortran never became my favorite language, so I just learned it to pass the course and then, I forgot it; but I will never forget the great time I spend playing with <i>Borland Pascal 7 IDE</i>.
</p>
<p>
The only thing that convinced me leave <i>Pascal</i> and move forward was the <i>C++</i> language. The excellent grammar, great features, extensive library, and flexibility of <i>C/C++</i> language is unbeatable. Since then, I have been playing with <i>C/C++</i> language both as a hobbyist and a freelancer.
</p>
<p>
If someone wants to become a good engineer, they should learn <i>MATLAB</i> programming, so did I. To be honest, even thouh <i>MATLAB</i> is a very powerful tool, I never became a big fan of it. I kept using <i>MATLAB</i> simply because I didn't know any better alternatives. About a year ago, I started switching to <i>Python</i> and <i>NumPy</i>. Based on my experiences so far, the combination of the two has the potential of replacing <i>MATLAB</i> in many computaional tasks. <i>Python</i> and <i>NumPy</i> are free, very well-maintained, well-documented, and rich in features, so I will keep using them.
